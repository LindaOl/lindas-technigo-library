# Library

Replace this readme with your own information about the project. You can include things like:

## Project description
The assignment is to make a website which is a library of recipes or books.

The project is an exercise in array and object. During the project I have practiced combining html, css and js files to make a website, and using id's and javascript to insert content onto the web page. As the instructions said I got to "apply concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, function definitions, conditional statements, variable assignment, and object and array manipulation."

## Approach
- After reading the instructions I looked through the files, and started by connecting the html to the .css and .js
- I made a couple of basic tags in the html to get started, header, nav, main, section, and footer.
- I watched vidoes and read up on how to get started with inserting content with javascript and started with the querySelector and code to add information from the array.
- Worked in Visual Studios, tested small bits of code in Codepen, used ChatGPT to ask about error messages, explain concepts I was unsure on and if the code wasn't working.
- Continued with how to make filtering buttons

How you approached the task, what tools and techniques you used, and how you planned it
- If you had more time, what would be next?
