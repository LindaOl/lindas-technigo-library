# Library

## Project description
The assignment is to make a website which is a library of recipes or books.

The project is an exercise in array and object. During the project I have practiced combining html, css and js files to make a website, and using id's and javascript to insert content onto the web page. As the instructions said I got to "apply concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, function definitions, conditional statements, variable assignment, and object and array manipulation."

## Approach
- After reading the instructions I looked through the files, and started by connecting the html to the .css and .js
- Created the basic structure with html tags, like header, nav, main, section, and footer.
- Watched vidoes and read up on how to insert content with javascript
- Started with the querySelector and code to add information from the array with objects.
- Tested small bits of code in Codepen, used ChatGPT to ask about error messages, explain concepts I was unsure on and ask why certain code wasn't working.
- Filtering buttons, then sorting.
- Experimentet with using symbols in the buttons.
- Code filters/sorting. Struggled with how sorting and filtering interacted.
- Made the frame for a searchbar, and later made code for it to work.
- Added another searchbar,than one that can "popup" for the smallest screens. Had to work with the id's and classes that was current at any point in the DOM to get it right.
- Tried to make common code for all searchbars, but they stopped working then. Went back to the more repetative code for it to work.
- Function to click on a recipe to display only that one.
- Had an issue with the site not displaying the correct recipe, and added code to give each recipe an id when page loads.
- Let sorting buttons get an icon when active.
- A lot of coding on this and that.
- Started styling, mobile first.
- Fixed code as I found new issues.
- Finished the styling.
- Added a fake login for fun, based on my signin page. Did not do uch with that part though. Copied from my other site and change a couple of colors.
- Tested in both Firefox and Chrome during the process.

## Tools and strategies
- Visual Studios
- Github
- codepen.io
- chatGPT
- google
- Pen and paper
- console.log to check my code


## If you had more time, what would be next?
- Made another attempt on merging the searchbar functions. Tried a couplke of times but it stopped working then.
- Adjusted the login to suit the rest better, lika not having the placeholder text become uppercase.
- Try to make the code more efficient, learn how to build functions better.
- Better understand how to make clean code with functions in a functions, a how it works.
- Make better variable names and go through id's and class names
- Would make preview displays when page loads and then have full display of the recipe when selected, but that wasn't the wording of the assignment.
- Play around with adding a "Add to favorites" function.
